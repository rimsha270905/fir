***HOW TO BECOME ENGINEER WITHOUT TAKING ENGINEER MAJOR!!
  Becoming a software engineer without a computer science (CS) major is entirely possible.
     -for that first you have to build a strong foundation
      1)learn programming basics
      programming is the core skill of software engineer . So start learning beginner 
      friendly languages which is python,javascript,ruby.
      you can learn it from online platforms or refer to beginner friendly books
      
      2)practice regularly  
      start to create simple projects and solve coding problems daily 
      first focus on small ana manageable problems and gradually increase the complexity

     3)learn cs fundamnetals
        Data Structures: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.
        Data Structures: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.
        Algorithms: Sorting (bubble sort, merge sort), searching (binary search), and     optimization.
        Databases: Learn how to store and retrieve data using SQL or NoSQL databases.
        Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Understand concepts like classes, objects,                        inheritance, and polymorphism.
     Version Control: Use Git and GitHub to manage code versions and collaborate with others.
     4)build projects
        employers and clients value practical experience over theoretical knowledge
        so first start building small projects like weather app using API or portfolio website and slowly movw to bigger projects like e-commerce websites.
use GitHub,heroku or netlify to showcase your projects online.

    5)consider bootcamps or certifications
       Bootcamps and certifications provide a structured learning path and can make your resume stand out.
    6)contribute to opensource
     " helps you gain experience,improve your skills and build a network in the developer community
   find projects in GitHub that intersts you and try to debug it or improve the documentation or add minor features.
    7)network and seek mentorship
      Networking can lead to job opportunities, collaborations, and valuable guidance.
      join developer communities,attend events like tech meetups and hackathons     
   8)apply for internships    
 Real-world experience is crucial to understanding industry workflows and expectations.    
Many companies offer internships to non-degree holders. Look for roles labeled as "entry-level" or "junior developer        
   9)prepare for interviews
      Software engineering interviews often test both technical skills and problem-solving abilities.  
         for coding interviews, practice coding questions and understand time complexity for your solutions
and for behavioral questions prepare answers to common questions like self introduction or
    "Describe a challenging project and how you handled it."      
  10)showcase your skills
A strong online presence can make you stand out to recruiters.
Portfolio Website:
Create a simple website to display your projects, skills, and contact information.
github:Keep your repositories organized and well-documented.
Include descriptive README files for your projects.
LinkedIn:
Update your profile with skills, projects, and certifications.
Write posts or share insights about your learning journey.
Blogs:
Share coding tutorials or your experiences. Platforms like Medium or Dev.to are great for reaching an audience.    
                                                                                                                                       By following these steps systematically, you can carve a path to becoming a successful software engineer without a formal engineering degree. The key is consistency, perseverance, and a passion for learning!
